                                                    GAUSSIAN BAYES THEOREM
                                        (Should be used if order of features dont matter)
                                    (Used widely for Spam Filters and Text based predictions)

Importing the Library:
    from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB

Creating a classifier:
    clf = GaussianNB()

Fit classifier with training data:
    clf.fit(features, values)

Predict value for a Feature:
    clf.predict(feature)

Accuracy of the Model:
    clf.score(test_features, test_labels)
